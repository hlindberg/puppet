========

SYNOPSIS
--------
  Produces remediation fixes for issues found when scanning for vulnerabilities.


USAGE
-----
puppet script [-h|--help] [-V|--version] [-d|--debug]
  [-i|--issue] [-f|--issue_file]
  [-v|--version]
  [-l|--logdest syslog|eventlog|<FILE>|console] [--noop]
  <file>


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Puppet fix can produce remediation fixes for known found (or explicitly given) issues, such as vulnerabilities.
When provided with a modulepath, via command line or config file, Puppet
Fix can load remediation fixes, functions, types, tasks and plans from modules.

Currently it offers output of instructions how to run an available fix given the id
of an issue (i.e. benchmark, vulnerability, issue).

Issues are mapped to fixes via hiera. Each module should bind its provided fixes
to a key '<mymodule>::fix::fixmap', where '<mymodule>' is the name of the module.
The bound value shoud be a hash with issue-id key and fix-id value.

The key 'fix::include_modules' should be bound to an array of module names from which fixes
should be included - it is looked up with unique merge.
This allows the configuration to differ depending on operating system.

An environment level 'fix::fixmap' is looked up and is deeply merge with higher priority
than any of the fixmaps found in modules. This allows the configuration to use fixes
from modules not containing fixmaps.

Benchmark ID
------------
The fully qualified benchmark ID is something like:

xccdf_org.cisecurity.benchmarks_benchmark_2.2.0.1_CIS_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_7_Benchmark/1.1.1.1_Ensure_mounting_of_cramfs_filesystem_is_disabled

Which is a horribly long thing to work with on the command line, and to use to switch between data sets in hiera.
When feeding a result from a scan, these identifiers are obtained from the result file. For command line work it is possible to provide short
form names that are read from a configuration file.

Benchmark identifiers also needs to be mapped to canonical values to be used in hiera as standardized by Facter facts.

---
benchmarks:
  - id: "xccdf_org.cisecurity.benchmarks_benchmark_2.2.0.1_CIS_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_7_Benchmark"
    facts: {
      benchmark: {
        version: "2.2.0.1"
        name: "cis_rhel7"
        family: "cis"
      }
      os: {
        name: "RedHat"
        family: "RedHat"
        release: {
          full: "7.2.1511"
          major: "7"
          minor: "2"
        }
      }
    }
  - "xccdf_org.cisecurity.benchmarks_benchmark_2.2.0.1_CIS_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_8_Benchmark"
    benchmark_name: "cis_rhel8"
    # rest as for rhel7

# Configure a default so this does not have to be given
default_benchmark: "rhel7"

This makes it possible to identify benchmarks as 'cis_rhel7', 'cis_rhel8', etc. and also provides the variable values for switching
data sets and mappings in hiera. The setting 'default_benchmark' makes it possible to just give the name of the benchmark check/rule.

OPTIONS
-------
* --issue
  The single issue for which some action is wanted. It is given on the form <mnemonic>::<section><name>. Mutually exclusive with --issues_file.

* --issues_file
  A yaml file with none/one or more issues for which some action is wanted. Mutually exclusive with --issue. (Not yet implemented)

* --version:
  The version of the benchmark for which the given --benchmark is a reference into.

* --benchmark
  The identity of the benchmark for which a fix is wanted

Note that any setting that's valid in the configuration
file is also a valid long argument. For example, 'environment' is a
valid setting, so you can specify '--environment mytest'
as an argument.

See the configuration file documentation at
https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/configuration.html for the
full list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all
configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with
'--genconfig'.

* --debug:
  Enable full debugging.

* --help:
  Print this help message

* --logdest:
  Where to send log messages. Choose between 'syslog' (the POSIX syslog
  service), 'eventlog' (the Windows Event Log), 'console', or the path to a log
  file. Defaults to 'console'.

  A path ending with '.json' will receive structured output in JSON format. The
  log file will not have an ending ']' automatically written to it due to the
  appending nature of logging. It must be appended manually to make the content
  valid JSON.

  A path ending with '.jsonl' will receive structured output in JSON Lines
  format.

* --noop:
  Use 'noop' mode where Puppet runs in a no-op or dry-run mode. This
  is useful for seeing what changes Puppet will make without actually
  executing the changes. Applies to tasks only.

EXAMPLES
--------
    $ puppet fix -i cis::1.1.1.1_Ensure_mounting_of_cramfs_filesysten_is_disabled
    $ puppet fix -i cis::Ensure_mounting_of_cramfs_filesysten_is_disabled
    $ puppet fix --modulepath=/root/dev/modules -e 'notice("hello world")'
